morning nothing good about it Man not here much but it must be a revolving door around here the faces are always
changing I am only here because my breathing is getting way worse and With this cough it's really hard to get a
full breath Then this burning in my chest isn't helping either So I need the inhalers that I got awhile back I
was trying to avoid them all together but now I am between a rock and a hard place My back pain keeps constantly
flaring up to add to everything else that's going on but not much I can do about it Whatever that’s not why I’m
here I don't want to spend all day here answering a bunch of questions for you But you're the boss Questions
questions and then more questions Great this ia all I need As I have said to you all before as far as I am
concerned it all started in Nam They sprayed a shitload of chemicals and told us they were safe After
breathing all that It seems that every year its getting worse Trying to sleep in a shelter or better yet
a holding cell full of dust and cock roach droppings doesn’t help  Then every morning we are kicked out
into this damn cold weather so then I am breathing in  cold air all day long No where I can really go
to stay warm So you just have to hope for the best or better yet a miracle I smoke as much as I can
about a half pack to a pack a week on a homeless man's salary Smoking helps me relax and gives me some
peace so I do what I have to to get them So if I have to panhandle or cash in bottles to buy them then
that's what I do If need be I can bum a few smokes off someone at the shelter in exchange for something
I have stashed like for a snack or a soda even so that's what I do for my sanity Of course I know the smoking
makes my breathing worse and this cough Do you think I’m stupid It's printed on the package What do you expect
from me I am  in the cold all day long and usually sleeping on the streets or in that dusty crowded shelter No
matter where I am I struggle to breathe or find myself wheezing especialliy in that shelter At least I get some
enjoyment from smoking When I had them I used them like I was told One I take when I really can’t breathe and
the other one was for every day But I wasn't selling them if that's what you think they were stolen and that's
the only reason why I came in Like I said I am only here because I can barely breathe If I had money to buy them
or could get them myself I won't be wasting you time or mine But I can’t afford the prescription they gave me and
I don't have insurance So I am hoping to gettrying to get those free samples again But just so you know I am
risking my neck using them they are a hot commodity Every addict is trying to get their hands on them to
increase their high no joke I got jumped They beat me bad just for a couple of inhalers and a backpack with
the few belongings that I have to my name And a bunch of newspaper I carry with me to stuff my clothes to stay
warm Besides using the inhalers is when a nearby church gave away winter scarves and face masks around Christmas
time then I could cover my face and I even got a pair of good gloves and some boots They were my life saver on
that day And I didn't have to use the one inhaler so much and I didn't  have to worry so much about losing my
fingers or toes to the cold Man What ahelp that was because breathing all that damn cold air makes it impossible
for me to breathe and then I get a hacking cough that just won't leave but it’s a But that was two years ago most
people only think about us when the season is right The shelter barely gives out any thing to really help in this
cold Oh maybe a cup or cofee or hot chocolate if they have it on hand That's not doing anything to help my breathing
or my freezing hands and feet for sure My face and arms It feels like it hurts everywhere Is that bad Ok but that's
gonna hurt I’m looking first at your leg You have a big gash Arms feel good Anything to stop the bleeding I'm having
difficulty breathing I'm getting a heaviness in my chest I'm ok just shaken up
